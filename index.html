                        During the summer of 2014 I worked as an intern software developer in SAP Business Objects. SAP produces the software that helps some of the world's 
                        most successful businesses run. I was part of a team that was involved in extending software to view large amounts of business intelligence data easily.
                        While at SAP I was exposed to both front and back end development using javascript and java, build infrastructure technologies like Jira and Maven and 
                        scrum methodologies.

                        GSOC is a global program that offers students stipends to write code for open source projects. As a GSOC student I was working on GCEStack 
                        and EC2Stack for Apache Cloudstack. GCEStack and EC2Stack act as bridges between Cloudstack and two popular Infrastructure as a Service platforms; Amazon 
                        Elastic Compute Cloud and Google Compute Engine. 
                        For GCEStack, the main goals were to rewrite it to work for the newly released GCE GA version. For EC2Stack, most of the work I was doing 
                        was extending it to cover more of the EC2 API. Both projects are written in Python and make use of the Flask framework.

                        then they would come to me for assistance. I was selected for the position given my high grades in previous years 
                        for Java modules.

                        MoodleFUSE aims to provide a simple way to map Moodle resources to a local filesystem. MoodleFUSE 
                        is written in python relies on the python binding of the FUSE kernel module to implement a Moodle filesystem in userspace. 
                        Typical file operations like listing, modifying, viewing, renaming and copying file entries can be carried out on the filesystem 
                        seamlessly. MoodleFUSE should make Moodle more accessible and easier to use for both lecturers and students.
